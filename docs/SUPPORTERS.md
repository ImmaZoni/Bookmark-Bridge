## Why We Need Support

Bookmark Bridge relies on Twitter/X's API, which has the following pricing tiers:

- **Free tier**: Extremely limited (1 request per 15 minutes)
- **Basic tier**: $100/month - Better rate limits and additional API endpoints
- **Enterprise tier**: $1,000+/month - Full capabilities

Your support helps us maintain API access at higher tiers to improve the plugin's functionality for everyone. With the Basic tier, we could implement:

- Faster syncing
- More metadata about bookmarks
- Historical data retrieval
- Improved error handling
